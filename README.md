### Overview

Kickstarter is one of the famous crowdfunding platforms used for gathering financial capital for creative, smart ideas. Each project has a deadline, as well as minimum funding goal and these funds, are provided by the Kickstarter-crowd who find these ideas interesting, sees potential in them and wants to support it. However, If the goal is not met by the chosen deadline, then no funds are collected, the project is terminated. We would like to analyze different attributes and factors that contributed to either success or failure of the projects launched on Kickstarter through interactive data visualization.
We will visually describe the different features related to projects. This data visualization will help us understand the probability of success of any idea and what can be done to increase the chance of getting funded without requiring additional knowledge about markets and finance since having successful funding is the first step for an idea to be successful.

### DataSets Source

* [Dataset from Kaggle] “Kickstarter Projects” by Mickaël Mouillé. It has more than 300,000 records from 2010 to 2018.

### Lessons

* For performing descriptive data analysis and visualization, we will perform data preprocessing, which will include checking the data types, checking for missing data or duplicates data. We will do data wrangling by calculating the day of the week, month in which the project was launched and calculate campaign duration using feature like launched and deadline date. By plotting different types of graphs, we will be learning about the dominating features for the success or failure of projects launched on
